   <h2 style=color:#e8aded> Card information</h2>
   <p style=color:#e0aded>Once a lonely pond duck, Quacknosis gazed into his reflection for maybe too long and 
    got a glimpse of the infinite ripples of his mind. In a second it shattered and expanded his consciousness at once.
    Now he drifts between thoughts and realities. Feared by some, worshiped by others, Quacknosis fights not for victory 
    but to quiet the endless quacking echoing inside his head.

 </p>
   </div>
    <div class="card">
     <h2 style=color:#e0aded>Environment</h2>
     <p style=color:#e0aded>Quacknosis thrives in reflective, mystical environments like the Pond of 
       Reflections. Still waters, misty areas, and places of deep meditation amplify his psychic powers, 
       allowing him to confuse enemies more effectively and deal increased mental damage. However, in 
       chaotic, loud, or heavily populated battlefields, his concentration is broken and his psychic 
       abilities are significantly weakened.</p>

    <div class="card">
    <h2 style=color:#e0aded>Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(220, 20, 60);">Fighting - Strength</h3>
    <p style=color:#e0aded>Quacknosis's psychic powers dominate physical fighters. His mind attacks 
      bypass physical defenses entirely, dealing double damage to fighting-type opponents who rely on 
      brute strength rather than mental fortitude. Confusion effects also disable their combat techniques.</p>
    <h3 style=color:#4c8939>Dark/Shadow - Weakness</h3>
    <p style=color:#e0aded>Dark and shadow-based opponents are immune to Quacknosis's psychic manipulation. 
      Their minds exist in chaos and darkness that his mental powers cannot penetrate. Dark attacks deal 
      increased damage and completely bypass his psychic defenses, forcing him to rely on his ducklings 
      for physical combat.</p>
