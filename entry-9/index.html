   <h2 style="color:#e4ca1f"> Card information</h2>
   <p style="color:#e4ca1f"> Buzz Raftor, a duck feared by all and understood by none. A
    legendary duck that one could only dream about becoming allies with. She comes out in
     battle only when absolutely necessary and never fails to accomplish what needs to get 
     done. She is a last resort for any team she's assigned to.

  <h2 style="color:#e4ca1f">Abilities</h2>
   <h3 style="color:#e4ca1f">MMMH THAT'S SOME GOOD MULCH</h3>
<p style="color:#e4ca1f">Buzz Raftor releases a fury of razor sharp woodchips that travel 
  faster than the speed of light, obliterating any duck that stands in her way. Deals the 
  remaining amount of health to any chosen enemy. This attack can only be used for one 
  round during the entire match.
</p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="card">
     <h2 style="color:#e4ca1f">Environment</h2>
     <p style="color:#e4ca1f">Buzz Raftor is a legendary duck who transcends environmental limitations. 
       She performs at peak power in any terrain, from Mulchy Pond to barren wastelands. Her legendary 
       status means no environment weakens her, though she seems to prefer areas rich with wood and 
       natural materials where her woodchip attacks have endless ammunition. Her presence alone changes 
       the battlefield, making any location her domain.
       </p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="card">
     <h2 style="color:#e4ca1f">Legendary Status</h2>
     <p style="color:#e4ca1f">As a legendary duck, Buzz Raftor has no traditional weaknesses. Her power 
       is absolute and her razor-sharp woodchip attack can instantly defeat any opponent. She can only 
       be summoned once per match and her ultimate ability can only be used once, making every appearance 
       a game-changing moment. Teams that have Buzz Raftor hold the ultimate trump card, though she only 
       fights when the stakes are highest. Her rarity and devastating power make her the most sought-after 
       duck in all of Feathered Fighters.
