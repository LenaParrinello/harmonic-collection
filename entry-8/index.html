   <h2 style="color:#4fa966"> Card information</h2>
   <p style="color:#4fa966"> Leafy was born with more than a nest connecting him to the trees. With a natural
    bond to nature and plant magic, he is a gentle sometimes wild duck who loves to explore, often getting distracted easily by new adventures.
    However when trouble appears, his wild nature turns into powerful protection for others. Although his vines can trip him up sometimes,
    he always fights with determination, kindness, and a touch of tangled unpredictability.

  <h2 style="color:#4fa966">Abilities</h2>
   <h3 style="color:#4fa966">Leafy's Feathers</h3>
<p style="color:#4fa966">Leafy shakes his wings launching a dangerous burst of
  razor sharp leaf feathers at his enemies. The attack is light but fast and deals 40 damage.
</p>
<h3 style="color:#4fa966">Quazy Vines</h3>
<p style="color:#4fa966">Leafy summons an unpredictable surge of twisting vines that attack his enemies from 
   all angles and deals 70 damage. Optional gambit: flip a coin. If heads, the vines will grow and deal 30 
   extra damage to all enemies on the battlefield. If tails, Leafy will trip on the overgrown vines and take 20 damage.
 </p>
   </div>
    <div class="card">
     <h2 style="color:#4fa966">Environment</h2>
     <p style="color:#4fa966">Leafy Feathers thrives in lush, verdant environments like Ponderleaf Pond. 
       Dense forests, overgrown gardens, and areas rich with plant life amplify his nature magic, giving him 
       bonus damage and faster vine growth. Sunlight filtering through leaves energizes his abilities. However, 
       in barren, dead, or urban environments with no vegetation, his plant-based powers are severely weakened.
       </p>
   </div>
    <div class="card">
    <h2 style="color:#4fa966">Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
    <h3 style="color:#69573c">Ground - Strength</h3>
    <p style="color:#4fa966">Leafy's roots penetrate deep into earth and rock. His plant-based attacks deal 
      double damage to ground-type opponents, draining nutrients from the soil to fuel his vines. Earth-bound 
      foes struggle against his entangling vegetation that spreads through any terrain.
        </p>
    <h3 style="color:#e34c26">Fire - Weakness</h3>
    <p style="color:#4fa966">Fire is Leafy's greatest weakness. His plant-based body and vine attacks are 
      extremely vulnerable to flames, taking triple damage from fire attacks. Heat withers his feathers and 
      burns his vines before they can even reach opponents, making fire-types his most dangerous matchup.
