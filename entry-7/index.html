   <h2 style=color:#e4531f> Card information</h2>
   <p style=color:#e4531f> Once mocked for frolicking instead of fighting by the elders of his pond, Mr Buff Beak
    trained until his feathers shined like armor. His body may be mighty but his heart stayed gentle.
    He doesn't fight to dominate but to protect the ducks he loves most, to prove that real strength comes from kindness 
    beneath the muscle.
</p>

  <h2 style=color:#e4531f>Abilities</h2>
   <h3 style=color:#e4531f>Mighty Wing</h3>
<p style=color:#e4531f>With one powerful flap Mr. Buff Beak sends a wave of wind that knocks his enemies off their feet. His
   muscles ripple as his attack cuts through the air dealing 20 damage to his opponent.
</p>
<h3 style=color:#e4531f>Atomic Quack</h3>
<p style=color:#e4531f>Mr. Buff Beak channels all his power into one pond-shattering quack that echoes 
  across the battlefield. The force blast enemies back and deals 100 damage.
 </p>
   </div>
    <div class="card">
     <h2 style=color:#e4531f>Environment</h2>
     <p style=color:#e4531f>Mr Buff Beak thrives in training grounds and open battlefields like the Iron Lily Pad. 
       Areas with solid footing and space to demonstrate his physical prowess amplify his strength-based attacks. 
       Open plains, gyms, and sturdy platforms give him bonus damage and stability. However, in slippery, 
       unstable, or confined spaces, his powerful movements are restricted and his attacks lose effectiveness.</p>

    <div class="card">
    <h2 style=color:#e4531f>Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
    <h3 style=color:#0d71ea>Water - Strength</h3>
    <p style=color:#e4531f>Mr Buff Beak's physical power gives him an advantage over water opponents. His powerful 
      strikes create shockwaves that disrupt water-based defenses, dealing increased damage to aquatic foes. 
      His muscular body moves effortlessly through water, turning the fluid environment into his advantage.</p>

    <h3 style=color:#f9e318>Lightning - Weakness</h3>
    <p style=color:#e4531f>Lightning attacks are devastating against Mr Buff Beak. His large, muscular body 
      attracts electrical charges, making him vulnerable to shocking strikes. Lightning deals increased damage 
      and can temporarily stun him, leaving him unable to use his powerful attacks effectively.</p>
